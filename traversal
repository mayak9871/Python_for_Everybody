#6.4: Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string 
#and works its way backwards to the first character in the string, 
#printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.

word = 'fruit'
index = -1
while index > -len(word) - 1:
  letter = word[index]
  print(letter)
  index = index - 1
